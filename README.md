### Features

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Vite: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects
- json-server: A full fake REST API with zero coding
- axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js
- react-toastify: A library for providing notifications
- uuid: A library for generating unique IDs
- useState, useEffect: React hooks for managing state and side effects

### Getting Started
